 <left>Throughout history, women have been discriminated against in a multitude of ways. More recently, many forms of sexism have been called out through such means as the #MeToo movement, and the Women's March in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, one form that this website attempts to help stop, is hiring bias. This issue is less noticeable and urgent, but very important nonetheless. The livelihoods of perfectly qualified candidates are dependant on their ability to be hired by companies. My research has concluded that employers in general favour people within their own group, be that male or female. Due to the fact that men are primarily in positions of power rather than women, this leads to male employers continues to hire men, who in turn, when they reach a position of influence, hire men, and so the cycle continues. The website I have created through HTML is addressed to employers, be they part of a majority or a minority, and it is intended to educate the users about methods to ensure that they maintain equality in the workplace. In addition to this, employers can email me with their practices, and I will evaluate whether they would be a useful addition to the site.</left>
